          <div class="panel-body">
            A: Some OTC medication orders currently do not come across to RxMAGIC. To dispense and print a label for this order in RxMAGIC, you want to first
            navigate to the appropriate patient's profile page. You can do this by navigating to 'Manage Patients' and selecting 'Advanced Search.' Enter
            the necessary credentials to the best of your ability, all fields are required but they do not need to be accurate. Once on the patient profile page, you will
            see a yellow button that says 'Dispense (No Rx).' Select this button and complete all of the fields to dispense and print a label, making sure to scan the barcode
            on the stock bottle from which you are dispensing.

        <div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse" aria-expanded="true" style="">
          <div class="panel-body">
            A: Short answer, yes! Go ahead and scan the bottle you’d like to dispense from and you shouldn’t have any problems. The inventory suggestions panel is
            meant to show you items in stock; these items are ranked by their expiry date. Items closest to expiry are listed first, which is intended to encourage
            you to dispense from items closer to expiry. Sometimes, prescribed medications don’t totally match the name of the inventory item (i.e. the generic form
            is prescribed but RxMAGIC lists the brand name). That is okay, you can still dispense from any bottle even if it doesn’t show up in the panel as long as
            there is sufficient inventory in RxMAGIC from the bottle you want to dispense.

            A: This was a problem when we first launched the system. Some of the medication names are too long and interfere with the barcode.
            To dispense from a bottle when the barcode won’t scan, simply type in the bottle ID (on the label) without the hyphen, followed by a $.
            For example, if the bottle ID is G0000-345, you will type in G0000345$.

            A: If you are unsure of how best to enter these items, check how they are already listed in the inventory or talk to other pharmacists.
            It is important items are entered in a way that most closely matches how they are prescribed. We have learned that entering all items using
            the generic form rather than brand name is the most suitable approach. For most pill bottles, the quantity is simply the number of pills in the bottle.
            In the case of eye drops/creams/insulin pens, the quantity should be entered as the weight of the item.
            For example, insulin pens are entered in 3 mL increments (5 pens = quantity 15 mLs) and creams are entered in grams.
            For inhalers, make sure the item name includes the total actuations, and then enter the quantity as 1.
